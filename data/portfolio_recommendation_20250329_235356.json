    "strategy": "Create a balanced portfolio by combining the most appropriate assets, with a focus on VZ and ET for their relatively low volatility and high Sharpe ratio. Add some exposure to VWO for its moderate returns and low downside deviation.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the client's risk tolerance of 3, we can identify the most suitable assets as those that balance return potential with risk management. VZ and ET exhibit relatively low volatility and high Sharpe ratios, making them attractive options. VWO, while not extremely aggressive, offers moderate returns and a relatively low downside deviation, which aligns well with the client's risk tolerance. On the other hand, TSLA and XPO are too risky due to their high volatility and potential for significant drawdowns. MSFT and AMZN, while having some appeal, may be too conservative for this risk tolerance, as they offer relatively low returns compared to the overall market."
