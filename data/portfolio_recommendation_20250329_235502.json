    "reasoning": "The client's risk tolerance of 1 indicates a very conservative approach. Assets like V and XLF have relatively low volatility and drawdowns, making them suitable for this risk profile. MSFT and AMZN, on the other hand, are too aggressive for this client, with higher volatility and potential losses. TSLA and ARKK are even more risky, with high volatility and significant potential losses. By combining V and XLF with some moderate-risk assets (e.g., JPM or VWO), we can create a portfolio that balances risk and return."
